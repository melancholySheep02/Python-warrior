A-game made using Data Structures in C++

Update:

This code was written in the late 2012. I just tried to re-run the code after a very very long time using Mingw64 and since some of these header files are not available for 64bit compiler or even 32 bit, i couldn't compile it.
These header files (dos.h and bios.h) are from 16-bit DOS compilers such as Turbo C or Open Watcom C. MinGW/MinGW is a 32/64-bit compiler for Windows. I wrote this code when i used to work on Turbo C++ in my school.
So if anyone wants to run this code (although its a very newbie way written code:P), Please go ahead and download Turbo C++ for windows and give it a try.
I don't have much time to go through this, refactor and migrate it to 64 bit compiler compatible code. If you want to contribute , feel free and go ahead , make the changes and send a PR. :)
